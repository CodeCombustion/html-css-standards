## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

The Nerdery’s perspective is that code exists to solve a problem. We favor solutions which are pragmatic and innovative over adherence to any one approach, abstraction, or toolset. Because the front-end engineering ecosystem is constantly evolving, a set of guidelines for working within it must continue to be relevant even as specific implementations change. We prioritize interoperability when choosing solutions, and use our guiding principles to write code that is resilient and easy to maintain. We also look to the practices of the front-end community as a whole to create a system of universal consistency.

This is a living document and is reflective of the opinions and expertise of The Nerdery’s front-end engineering group. However, the discussion of, contribution to, and evolution of this document is reliant on the front-end community both inside and outside of The Nerdery.

### Guiding Principles

* Code should first and foremost be resilient.
* Solutions should focus on the best approach for a given problem space, and should not be limited by adherence to implementation details.
* Discretion should be exercised when selecting tools to solve a problem, preferring those that inherently resonate with the methodology over those that do not.
* The methodology should be agnostic to the development context in which it is being applied.
* Consider best practices as thematic and conceptual guidelines, not literal dictates.
* Consider code to be both an artifact that promotes adoption and suggests best practices in its composition.


### Standards
The standards are hard rules which should be enforceable via automated tools like linters; they are the base upon which consistent and interchangeable code is written.

### Methodology
The methodology consists of the best practices, engineering principles, and philosophies which guide coded implementations. It represents the unified perspective and expectations that define quality code.
